# ft_containers

In this project, you will implement the various container types of the C++ standard template library.

For each container, turn in the appropriately named class files.
The namespace will always be ft and your containers will be tested using ft::<container>.

You need to respect the structure of the reference container. If itâ€™s missing a part of the orthodox canonical form, do not implement it.
As a reminder, we are coding in C++98, so any new feature of the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every old feature (even deprecated) is expected.

## Containers
 
- [x] Vector
- [x] Map
- [x] Stack

## Tester

Run all tests : ''sh tester_linux.sh'' or ''sh tester_mac.sh''.

Run only test on a specific container : ''sh tester_linux.sh <container>'' or ''sh tester_mac.sh <container>''.
